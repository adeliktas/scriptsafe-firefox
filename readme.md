# ScriptSafe
The well known browser extension/addon that gives users control of the web and more secure browsing while emphasizing simplicity and intuitiveness.

Since the original developer seemingly has abandoned the project, i have decided to try to keep it up to date.
The scriptsafe addon for firefox, which was removed from addons.mozilla.org, will primarily receive support.

Support for other browsers such as chrome or opera will possibly be added in 2022.
